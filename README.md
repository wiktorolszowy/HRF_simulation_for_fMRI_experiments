# HRF_simulation_for_fMRI_experiments
The fMRI time series are simulated given a set of options the user can specify. Afterwards, the models are estimated and significance of the stimulus response is assessed. There are 6 HRF models available: (1) canonical double-gamma, (2-3) extension by its derivatives, (4) nonlinear double gamma, (5) inverse logit and (6) finite impulse response.
